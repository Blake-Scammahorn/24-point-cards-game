# 24-point-cards-game
Play the 24 point game using the values of playing cards.

  The rules are as such:

  In a window, you are given four card images. Each card has a value, 1 for aces through 11, 12, and 13 for Jacks, Queens, and Kings 
respectively.  Mousing over the card displays its value.

  The goal is to use any mathematical expression that uses each number (once only) that evaluates to 24 (rounded down for the result, as 
its converted to int at the very end).
 
  When you win or when you click the "Draw next hand" button, you put your current hand on the bottom of the deck and draw the top 
four cards.  You can also click "Shuffle and draw" to shuffle your old hand into the deck and draw a new set of four cards.
